Allows woocommerce administrator enforce strong password usage.

== Description ==

Security is a big concern for ecommerce (or any websites) today. Wordpress by default doesn't enforce user's password when people sign up or update them. Who is liable when your user's account got hack? Why get into this dilemma when you can prevent this? 

This plugin gives you the flexibility of enforcing user's password format (password length, combination of numbers, lowercase chars, uppercase chars or special chars) for woocommerce. The same outcome could be achieved by using a standard wordpress plugin but this plugin does the woocommerce way.
